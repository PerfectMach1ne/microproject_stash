# Faust v0.0.1

Listen, I like the green squares, alright?
But I cannot code all the time! So, I made an app to let me add green squares even when I don't code!
Isn't that so nice!

# JSON WagnerDoc v0x1 specification

There are two files: `public_wd.json`, `protected_wd.json` and `private_wd.json`. Each contains a list of JSON objects that represent things I've done, though `protected_wd.json` contains only IDs of `private_wd.json`.

Each object has a few properties:

- `id` - a thing-that-was-done ID.
- `date` - a datetimestamp lazily generated by JavaScript.
- `thingdoing` - description of the thing that was done.

As this version is for a 15 minute project, I really do not need anything else right now LOL!!!
