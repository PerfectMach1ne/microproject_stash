# Changeling v0.0.1

For helping me update the P2E/Co-Re changelog on a GitHub Pages website.

### Installation (to my knowledge)

##### Install Node for running `app.js`

`npm install -D changeling`

##### Install ActiveTcl for running `cli.tcl`

#### Windows

You'll have to use the [dreaded installer](https://platform.activestate.com/ActiveState/ActiveTcl-8.6/auto-fork), lmao.

#### Unix/Linux distributions (don't ask me which ones, I have no idea!)

`apt-get install tcl`

Optionally, also use the [installer](https://platform.activestate.com/ActiveState/ActiveTcl-8.6/auto-fork).

#### Mac

I'm not familiar enough with the system to know about any install commands, but ActiveState also provided and [installer](https://platform.activestate.com/ActiveState/ActiveTcl-8.6/auto-fork).
